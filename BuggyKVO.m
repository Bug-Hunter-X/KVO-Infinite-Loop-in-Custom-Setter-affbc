In Objective-C, a subtle issue can arise when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) with custom setters. If a custom setter modifies other properties, and those properties also have KVO observers, it can lead to unexpected behavior and infinite loops. This is because the change in the secondary property triggers another KVO notification, which might in turn call the original setter again, creating a cycle.
